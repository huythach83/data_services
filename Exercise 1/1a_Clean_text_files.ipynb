    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three files: PreStuTrips.txt and PostStutrips.txt and convert.shp.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Please import the PreStuTrips.txt and PostStutrips.txt files into a Microsoft SQL server database and find the differences between the PostStutrips.txt and the PreStuTrips.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Please convert the convert.shp file from the negative coordinates\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Upon inspecting the source text file (**PreStuTrips.txt** and **PostStutrips.txt**):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each row has 3 columns, and the columns names have mixed up between ***Student ID*** and ***Edulog ID***\n",
    "- The data might be scrapped from a website with pagination, hence the ***Pag    x*** text\n",
    "- All the data is taken at Apr/13/2020\n",
    "- The columns name appear at the beginning of each page\n",
    "- There's an blank line at the end of each page.\n",
    "- The data of each column is separated by a bunch of space. The same with columns name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon further inspection, I knew that the text ***Student ID*** only appears once in the first page. I decided to do the following step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove all the columns name from each page, except the first page.\n",
    "- Replace each instance of multiple spaces (at least 2 spaces) with comma (,)\n",
    "- Remove all the blank line\n",
    "- Remove all the line with date and Page indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will be a *.csv* file that can be use to import into MS SQL database\n",
    "\n",

    "> python 1a_Clean_text_files.py \\<filename\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "After import into MS SQL as 2 tables: ***pre*** for **PreStuTrips.txt** and ***post*** for **PostStutrips.txt**, we can use the following querry to compare 2 tables:\n",

    "SELECT * FROM post\n",

    "\n",
    "The above query compare the difference between ***pre*** and ***post***. There're 48 rows in total\n",

    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM post\n",
    "EXCEPT\n",
    "SELECT * FROM pre\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will compare the difference between ***post*** and ***pre***. This time there're 6 rows\n",
    "\n",
    "This happened because the number of row of ***pre*** table larger than that of ***post*** by 48 rows, and in ***post***, there're 6 rows that have different values compared to those of ***pre***.\n",
